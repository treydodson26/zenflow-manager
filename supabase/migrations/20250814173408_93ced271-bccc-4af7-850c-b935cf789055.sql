'Hi {{first_name}},

I hope you''ve had a chance to try your first class with us! How did it feel?

Whether you''ve been once or several times already, I wanted to share some exclusive perks that come with being part of our intro offer:

üéØ **Personal attention**: Our instructors know you''re new and will check in with you
üîÑ **Free class swaps**: Need to change your booking? No problem, just let us know
üìö **Free workshops**: Join our monthly "Yoga Fundamentals" workshop (usually $25)

**Most popular classes for new students:**
‚Ä¢ Gentle Flow (perfect for building strength gradually)
‚Ä¢ Yin Yoga (deep stretching and relaxation)
‚Ä¢ Yoga Basics (learn proper alignment)

Remember, yoga is a practice - not a performance. Every day on the mat is different, and that''s exactly how it should be.

What questions can I answer for you?

'Hi {{first_name}},

It''s been a week since you joined us - how amazing is that?

Whether you''ve made it to one class or five, you''re already building something beautiful: a yoga practice that''s uniquely yours.

**This week, I invite you to:**
‚Ä¢ Try a different style of class (maybe Yin if you''ve been doing Flow?)
‚Ä¢ Notice how you feel before vs. after class
‚Ä¢ Set an intention at the beginning of each practice
‚Ä¢ Be kind to yourself - progress isn''t always linear

**Student spotlight:** "I was so nervous for my first class, but Emily and the community made me feel so welcome. A week later, I''ve been to 4 classes and I''m sleeping better than I have in months!" - Sarah M.

**Trending classes this week:**
‚Ä¢ Tuesday 7:30am - Morning Flow (great way to start the day!)
‚Ä¢ Thursday 6:00pm - Power Flow (build strength and heat)
‚Ä¢ Sunday 10:00am - Community Class (relaxed, social atmosphere)

You have 23 more days of unlimited classes. What do you want to explore?

Cheering you on,

-- Day 10 - Mid-trial motivation
(10, 'email', 'The magic happens when you keep showing up üí´', 
'Hi {{first_name}},

You''re 10 days into your yoga journey, and I wanted to check in with something important:

The magic of yoga doesn''t happen in a single class, or even in a week. It happens when you keep showing up, especially on the days when you don''t feel like it.

Maybe you''ve noticed some changes already:
‚Ä¢ Sleeping a little better?
‚Ä¢ Feeling more flexible?
‚Ä¢ Finding moments of calm in your day?
‚Ä¢ Building strength you didn''t know you had?

Or maybe you''re still waiting for that "yoga magic" everyone talks about. That''s completely normal too. Some of our most dedicated students tell me it took 3-4 weeks before they really felt the shift.

**Your challenge for this week:**
Try to come to class on a day when you''re tempted to skip. Those are often the most transformative practices.

**Classes perfect for "I don''t feel like it" days:**
‚Ä¢ Restorative Yoga (pure relaxation)
‚Ä¢ Gentle Flow (movement without intensity)
‚Ä¢ Meditation class (just 30 minutes of stillness)

You''re doing great. Trust the process.

With love,
Emily

'Hi {{first_name}},

You''re officially halfway through your 30-day intro offer! üéâ

I''m genuinely curious: How has your experience been so far? What''s surprised you most about yoga or our studio?

As you head into your second half, I want to plant a seed about what your yoga practice could look like beyond these 30 days.

**Our membership options:**
‚Ä¢ **Unlimited Monthly**: $120/month for unlimited classes
‚Ä¢ **8 Classes/Month**: $85/month (perfect for 2x per week)
‚Ä¢ **4 Classes/Month**: $55/month (great for busy schedules)
‚Ä¢ **Drop-in Rate**: $20 per class

**But here''s what I really want you to know:** This isn''t about selling you something. It''s about supporting whatever feels right for YOUR life and YOUR practice.

Some students thrive coming every day. Others find their sweet spot at 2-3 times per week. There''s no wrong way to do yoga.

**Questions to consider:**
‚Ä¢ How often do you realistically want to practice?
‚Ä¢ What time of day works best for your schedule?
‚Ä¢ Which teachers and class styles resonate with you?

We''ll talk more about options as your trial progresses, but for now, just keep exploring and enjoying the journey.

You''re doing beautifully.

-- Day 21 - Week 3 momentum
(21, 'email', 'Week 3: When everything starts to click ‚ú®', 
'Hi {{first_name}},

Week 3 is magical in yoga.

This is often when students tell me: "Something just clicked!" Maybe it''s finally touching your toes, holding a pose that felt impossible, or simply feeling more at home in your body.

**Celebrating your progress:**
Take a moment to acknowledge how far you''ve come. The person who walked into their first class 3 weeks ago is not the same person reading this email. You''ve grown stronger, more flexible, and more connected to yourself.

**As we head into your final week:**
I want you to start thinking about your yoga practice as a relationship. Like any good relationship, it thrives with consistency, patience, and showing up even when it''s not convenient.

**Member exclusive preview:**
Our unlimited monthly members get access to:
‚Ä¢ All regular classes + special workshops
‚Ä¢ Member-only events (monthly social nights!)
‚Ä¢ 20% off retail and private sessions
‚Ä¢ Guest passes for friends
‚Ä¢ Priority booking for workshops and retreats

**Your next step:**
Schedule a quick 10-minute chat with me before your trial ends. We''ll talk about your experience and find the perfect membership option for your lifestyle. No pressure - just honest conversation about what works for you.
