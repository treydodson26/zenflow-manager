You''re 10 days into your yoga journey, and I wanted to check in with something important:

The magic of yoga doesn''t happen in a single class, or even in a week. It happens when you keep showing up, especially on the days when you don''t feel like it.

Maybe you''ve noticed some changes already:
‚Ä¢ Sleeping a little better?
‚Ä¢ Feeling more flexible?
‚Ä¢ Finding moments of calm in your day?
‚Ä¢ Building strength you didn''t know you had?

Or maybe you''re still waiting for that "yoga magic" everyone talks about. That''s completely normal too. Some of our most dedicated students tell me it took 3-4 weeks before they really felt the shift.

**Your challenge for this week:**
Try to come to class on a day when you''re tempted to skip. Those are often the most transformative practices.

**Classes perfect for "I don''t feel like it" days:**
‚Ä¢ Restorative Yoga (pure relaxation)
‚Ä¢ Gentle Flow (movement without intensity)
‚Ä¢ Meditation class (just 30 minutes of stillness)

You''re doing great. Trust the process.

With love,
Emily

**Why continue?**
You''ve invested 30 days in building this practice. Don''t let that momentum disappear. Yoga compounds - the benefits multiply the longer you stick with it.

(21, 'email', 'Week 3: When everything starts to click ‚ú®', 
'Hi {{first_name}},

Week 3 is magical in yoga.

This is often when students tell me: "Something just clicked!" Maybe it''s finally touching your toes, holding a pose that felt impossible, or simply feeling more at home in your body.

**Celebrating your progress:**
Take a moment to acknowledge how far you''ve come. The person who walked into their first class 3 weeks ago is not the same person reading this email. You''ve grown stronger, more flexible, and more connected to yourself.

**As we head into your final week:**
I want you to start thinking about your yoga practice as a relationship. Like any good relationship, it thrives with consistency, patience, and showing up even when it''s not convenient.

**Member exclusive preview:**
Our unlimited monthly members get access to:
‚Ä¢ All regular classes + special workshops
‚Ä¢ Member-only events (monthly social nights!)
‚Ä¢ 20% off retail and private sessions
‚Ä¢ Guest passes for friends
‚Ä¢ Priority booking for workshops and retreats

**Your next step:**
Schedule a quick 10-minute chat with me before your trial ends. We''ll talk about your experience and find the perfect membership option for your lifestyle. No pressure - just honest conversation about what works for you.

9 more days of unlimited access. Make them count!

With admiration,
